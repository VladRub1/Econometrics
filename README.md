# Econometrics

In this repository, you will find implemented author's projects in econometrics
divided into different tasks:
* **[Cluster Analysis](./Cluster-analysis)**:
  **cluster analysis**, including _theoretical and practical assignments_ with 
  code writing and visualization of results
* **[Dimensionality Reduction](Dimensionality-reduction)**: 
  dimensionality reduction using **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis), including 
  _theoretical and practical assignments_ based on data about protest activity 
  in European Union countries
* **[Factor Analysis](./Factor-analysis)**: 
  **factor analysis**, applied to study the relationships between variable values 
  based on the 6th wave of the 
  [World Values Survey research](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org)
* **[Regression Analysis](./Regression-analysis)**: 
  various works in the field of **regression analysis** and its applications:
  * _Interaction Variable_
  * _Multiple Regression_ with interpretation and _causal inference_
  * _Panel Data Analysis_ (including Fixed-Effects, Random-Effects, 
    and Mixed-Effects models)

Some materials are taken from course materials on probability theory, mathematical 
statistics, linear algebra, multivariate statistical analysis, and regression 
analysis from the [Department of Higher Mathematics](https://hmat.hse.ru/) of the 
HSE University.
